# Deep-Learning-TensorFlow

This Project is a Hello World using TENSORFLOW for deep learning comprehension.
This is an implementation of the example showed in the "sentdex" YouTube channel. 

Here we can see how to model and train a simple deep neural network for recognizing numbers
from 0 to 9.

Initially we are using CPU on windows 10 operational system. You can install
TensorFlow by only using python 3.5 and using "pip3 install tensorflow" Command.

On deep-net.py we start modeling our network setting how many layers and nodes for example.
The file has more detailed comments explaining how it works.
